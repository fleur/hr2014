CURATES.IO

Ever wanted to find a list of links to the best content on any particular subject in one place?

Forget about trawling through Google to find the best Angular.js tutorials, or a collection of great startup essays, or photos of street fashion from Milan. Curates.io is your solution.

We are building a social network to share collections of curated web pages. 
Users can:
    - Create collections of links to any webpage they find interesting. 
    - Each collection should have a similar theme, and will have a designated url.
    - Each collection is then published to the social network and viewable by other users on a central feed.
    - Other users can upvote collections which they find helpful.
    - Collections with high upvotes will appear higher on the central feed.
    - Users can also manually share their collections by sharing the designated url for that collection.

In essence, Curates.io is a social network to make collections of high-quality information as liquid as possible.

As one user says: "Brilliant, I no longer have to wade through the fecal matter that is 99% of the internet. Now all the high quality stuff are in one place".
